 <h4>Why Software Engineering?</h4>
    <p>In this fast evolving technology world,I dont want to be left behind! Having been in customer service for nine years I beleive its time for career transition because 
     I know what users of technology want and need.
        My mission is to be a professional UX/UI Designer by year 2025 and since Software Engineering has some taste in it,
        thus my decision,however am still contemplating between the UX/UI and Software Development.Am finding Software 
        Engineering interesting and a bit challenging and hopefully before the end of the course,I will have made a choice
        of which career path to follow.
